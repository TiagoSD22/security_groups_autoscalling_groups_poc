note right of PublicSG
    Security Groups are stateful.
    Ingress and Egress rules are evaluated
    for each packet.
end note

note bottom of NACL
    Network ACLs are stateless and operate
    at the subnet level, providing an additional
    layer of security.
end note

note bottom of RouteTable
    Route Tables define how traffic is routed
    within the VPC and to external networks.
